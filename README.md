# Microduck challenges

One folder per challenge open on the Microduck Arena. Each is a complete,
working training environment: train it unchanged and the robot competes.

| Folder | Arena event | Task |
|---|---|---|
| sprint_2m | sprint-2m | Mjlab-Sprint2m-MicroDuck |
| got_a_talent | got-a-talent | Mjlab-GotATalent-MicroDuck |
| hill_climb_1m5 | hill-climb-1m5 | Mjlab-HillClimb1m5-MicroDuck |
| roller_sprint_2m | roller-sprint-2m | Mjlab-RollerSprint2m-MicroDuck |

MicroDuck Got a Talent is a performance, not a race: the Arena plays the entry's
`timeline.json` for up to 20 s on an open stage, and visitors vote.
`got_a_talent/timeline.json` is Pollen's: `twist[0]` is the sit flag (1 sits,
0 stands) and `head` is 4 deltas in radians from the default pose (neck_pitch,
head_pitch, head_yaw, head_roll). Check a policy against a timeline with
`uv run --frozen --group workshop python -m microduck_challenges.got_a_talent.check policy.onnx [--timeline FILE]`,
and publish the timeline with the policy: `uv run publish … --timeline src/microduck_challenges/got_a_talent/timeline.json`.

## The workshop

Each challenge's page on the Arena has a **Train my own robot** button with one line to copy:

```bash
uv run https://pollen-robotics-microduck-arena.hf.space/workshop.py sprint-2m
```

It works in the clone you run it in (or clones this repo next to you) and opens the workshop in your
browser, on that challenge. Its home says what is set up (Hugging Face Jobs billing, your fork, an
NVIDIA GPU) and lists the challenges. A challenge's page says which files to change, commits them
before each training, trains on your NVIDIA GPU or on Hugging Face Jobs, and keeps one ticket per
training: every checkpoint is evaluated with the Arena's own rules as it arrives. A training's page
replays any checkpoint, and **Publish and compete** publishes the policy to your Hugging Face account
**and enters** it on the Arena, then opens its result. On MicroDuck Got a Talent, a training's page
also edits `timeline.json`, your performance, and plays it with the checkpoint you pick. From a clone,
`uv run --group workshop workshop` opens the home and `uv run --group workshop workshop sprint-2m`
opens one challenge.

## Train from a shell

Needs Python 3.12 and `uv`. Training needs an NVIDIA GPU, or Hugging Face Jobs.

While the Arena wheel sits on a private Hub repo, EVERY `uv` command in this
checkout needs `HF_TOKEN` — even a plain `uv run` re-checks the lock and
re-fetches the wheel URL, and gets a 401 without it. Log in once
(`hf auth login`), then export the token in the shell (or its profile) before
any `uv` command:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/pollen-robotics/microduck-challenges && cd microduck-challenges
export HF_TOKEN=$(cat ~/.cache/huggingface/token)   # while the Arena wheel is private
uv sync --group workshop
uv run train Mjlab-Sprint2m-MicroDuck --env.scene.num-envs 4096 --agent.max-iterations 3000 \
    --agent.seed 1 --agent.logger tensorboard --agent.run-name first
# no GPU: add --hf-jobs --no-wandb
```

A challenge's knobs are in its `challenge.toml` (`[params]`); its whole
environment is in `env.py`. Edit either, commit, train. To add a custom
reward, write the function in a `rewards.py` next to the challenge's `env.py`
and add it to `cfg.rewards` in `env.py`.

`--hf-jobs` trains on Hugging Face's infrastructure instead of a local GPU;
nothing lands in `logs/rsl_rl/` here. Its checkpoints go to the Hub repo the
submission prints (`[ckpt] checkpoints -> <repo>`), mirroring `logs/rsl_rl/` —
bring them back before publishing:

```bash
uv run hf download <that repo> --local-dir logs/rsl_rl
```

Then publish and enter it in one command:

```bash
uv run publish --run logs/rsl_rl/<folder>/<run> --repo <you>/microduck-<name> --no-private --enter
```

It uploads the policy to your Hugging Face account, enters it on the
challenge's event on the Arena, and prints its time and the page of its result.
`publish` creates a new Hub repo private by default, and the Arena reads public
repos only: hence `--no-private`.

## Tests

```bash
uv run --group workshop pytest
```

(the tests import the Arena, which lives in the `workshop` group).
